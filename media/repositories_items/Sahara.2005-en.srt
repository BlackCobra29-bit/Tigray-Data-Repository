1
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:06,288
Let's go!

2
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,687
Incoming!

3
00:01:19,503 --> 00:01:21,700
- Sorry, captain.
- It's all right, son.

4
00:01:21,744 --> 00:01:23,600
That's the future in your hands.

5
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,536
Heave! Heave! Heave!

6
00:01:28,304 --> 00:01:30,704
- Starboard gunners ready, captain.
- Lieutenant.

7
00:01:34,992 --> 00:01:36,272
Fire!

8
00:01:40,112 --> 00:01:42,000
Prepare to take us into the channel.
Ahead a half.

9
00:01:42,224 --> 00:01:44,144
- Make revolutions for five knots.
- Aye, sir.

10
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:53,392
- Range, 150 yards!
- 150 yards!

11
00:01:56,688 --> 00:01:58,192
Fire!

12
00:02:01,168 --> 00:02:02,160
Fire!

13
00:02:05,744 --> 00:02:06,768
Fire!

14
00:02:12,784 --> 00:02:14,320
- All ahead full.
- Aye, captain.

15
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:47,473
Stop engines.

16
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:49,648
- Captain?
- Stop engines! Run silent!

17
00:02:50,289 --> 00:02:51,472
Cease firing!

18
00:02:51,664 --> 00:02:55,153
Cease firing!
Close the gun ports. Hold still.

19
00:02:55,345 --> 00:02:57,424
- Cease firing!
- Close the gun ports!

20
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:26,004
Mrs. Nwokolo?

21
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,980
Eva Rojas, World Health Organization.
This is Dr. Hopper.

22
00:07:29,204 --> 00:07:31,092
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Please come with me.

23
00:07:35,732 --> 00:07:38,580
Sorry about the dark.
The light hurts his eyes.

24
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:40,244
- Thank you.
- What's his name?

25
00:07:40,436 --> 00:07:42,581
Azikiwe. Most call him Kiwe.

26
00:07:42,773 --> 00:07:44,885
Hi, Kiwe. My name is Eva.

27
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:47,444
We need to have a little look
at you, okay?

28
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,493
- How long has he been sick?
- For two days.

29
00:07:49,685 --> 00:07:52,661
- Has he traveled anywhere recently?
- He was in Mali last week.

30
00:07:53,108 --> 00:07:54,324
With his father.

31
00:07:54,869 --> 00:07:57,557
- Where is his father now?
- He's at the lighthouse.

32
00:07:57,749 --> 00:07:58,933
That's where he works.

33
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,533
Blood pressure, 80/50.

34
00:08:00,757 --> 00:08:02,804
- Circulatory failure.
- Drawing blood.

35
00:08:06,548 --> 00:08:08,917
- Easy, son. Easy. No, no.
- Kiwe!

36
00:08:09,109 --> 00:08:10,772
- Sedative, Eva.
- What dose?

37
00:08:10,964 --> 00:08:12,020
Two mils.

38
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:14,549
Easy, son. Easy. No. It's okay.

39
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:16,981
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
Just trying to help.

40
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,997
It's okay. It's okay, Kiwe.

41
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:20,852
It's okay.

42
00:08:21,205 --> 00:08:24,373
- Your mama... Your mama is here.
- It's okay, Kiwe. It's okay.

43
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:29,301
You all right?

44
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:32,373
- Mali, just like the others.
- Yeah, I know.

45
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:36,021
- This is an outbreak, Frank.
- We've got six cases.

46
00:08:36,213 --> 00:08:38,421
- That's not enough.
- Oh, how many do we need?

47
00:08:38,613 --> 00:08:39,925
Sixty?

48
00:08:40,117 --> 00:08:41,717
Six thousand?

49
00:08:43,061 --> 00:08:45,013
When does it start to matter?

50
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:55,317
We have to find the source, Frank.

51
00:08:57,333 --> 00:08:59,349
You wanna go to Mali.

52
00:08:59,637 --> 00:09:00,630
It's not gonna happen.

53
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:04,629
WHO isn't gonna lose
any more staff to a civil war.

54
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:08,181
- Here, finish your report.
- Good.

55
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:10,869
- Just in time for the autopsy.
- Eva.

56
00:09:14,646 --> 00:09:16,405
I'll do what I can do.

57
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:19,190
I'll re-present to the board.

58
00:09:19,382 --> 00:09:22,197
- And maybe they'll listen this time.
- Thank you.

59
00:09:23,478 --> 00:09:25,077
We still need blood samples
from his father.

60
00:09:25,269 --> 00:09:26,901
I'll find the father.

61
00:09:48,886 --> 00:09:50,198
Hello?

62
00:09:53,238 --> 00:09:54,998
Mr. Nwokolo?

63
00:10:04,694 --> 00:10:06,230
Mr. Nwokolo?

64
00:10:34,646 --> 00:10:36,055
Hey!

65
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:38,998
Help.

66
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,567
You have no business being here.

67
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,719
Quick, get her bag.

68
00:11:26,903 --> 00:11:28,887
Are you okay?

69
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:02,231
Hey! Hey, pick that up!

70
00:12:02,423 --> 00:12:04,696
What are you doing? Come on.

71
00:12:04,888 --> 00:12:07,991
You're walking past...
All right, guys. Come on.

72
00:12:08,183 --> 00:12:11,224
Guys, quit screwing around.

73
00:12:11,512 --> 00:12:15,544
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on. All right, stop.

74
00:12:15,736 --> 00:12:17,176
All right, hold it there.

75
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:19,448
Report any variances over two feet.

76
00:12:22,808 --> 00:12:25,720
Here, hold on to these.
Come on, grab it.

77
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,720
All right. Come on, you piece of...

78
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,568
All right, give me a wrench.
I need the wrench.

79
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
Wrench! Anybody there?

80
00:12:37,112 --> 00:12:41,720
All right, oil. I need the oil.
All right, the oil. Thank you.

81
00:12:43,768 --> 00:12:47,608
That's it. All right, we're good!
We're good!

82
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,528
Sorry.

83
00:12:49,752 --> 00:12:52,504
Here. Hi.

84
00:12:52,696 --> 00:12:54,232
- Al Giordino.
- Eva.

85
00:12:54,456 --> 00:12:56,217
- Eva Rojas.
- Nice work.

86
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:57,753
- Thanks.
- Welcome aboard.

87
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,256
Thank you.

88
00:13:00,376 --> 00:13:04,920
All right, turn it on. Go down.
Go, go, go, go, go.

89
00:13:05,112 --> 00:13:07,257
More. Keep going.

90
00:13:07,896 --> 00:13:09,336
Hi.

91
00:13:09,528 --> 00:13:11,224
- How are you? Feeling better?
- Yes, thank you.

92
00:13:11,416 --> 00:13:12,568
- I'm Rudi.
- Sorry, where are we?

93
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,576
This is the Martha Ann,
It's a NUMA boat. Ship.

94
00:13:15,768 --> 00:13:18,329
We didn't know who you were, so
we kind of patched you up ourselves.

95
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:20,217
You had an edema
of the upper tracheal track.

96
00:13:20,409 --> 00:13:23,160
Rudi, I've been waiting
two months for this moment.

97
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:25,272
Don't mess it up for me
by letting him drown.

98
00:13:25,497 --> 00:13:27,672
- Yes, admiral.
- Diver up!

99
00:13:27,864 --> 00:13:32,664
In five, counting,
four, three, two, one.

100
00:13:45,401 --> 00:13:47,961
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I introduce to you

101
00:13:48,153 --> 00:13:52,249
after a 772-year engagement
on the bottom of the ocean:

102
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:55,161
King Bateen!

103
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,217
Nice job, everyone.

104
00:14:01,177 --> 00:14:02,713
Except you, Al. What the hell?

105
00:14:02,905 --> 00:14:05,977
It's a 10-ton-rated winch,
my friend, not a fly-fishing rod.

106
00:14:06,169 --> 00:14:08,377
You know what? You're thinking
of the Thompson 12-91.

107
00:14:08,569 --> 00:14:10,618
Whereas you're astride a 12-93.

108
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,018
- Not that you could operate either one.
- Boys!

109
00:14:13,210 --> 00:14:14,137
- Sir?
- Sir?

110
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:16,858
The king meets the people
at the museum in five hours.

111
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:18,937
- Don't worry, sir. He'll be there.
- He'll be there.

112
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,057
He better be.

113
00:14:20,281 --> 00:14:21,817
Secure those cables!

114
00:14:22,937 --> 00:14:25,753
Hey, look who's on her feet.

115
00:14:25,978 --> 00:14:27,097
Thanks to you, I guess.

116
00:14:27,737 --> 00:14:30,778
You were lucky to just lose your bag.
Dangerous city.

117
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:32,890
Damn it, I did lose my bag.

118
00:14:33,113 --> 00:14:36,538
- Nothing worth dying for, I hope.
- Well, that's a tough question.

119
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:38,521
Nothing worth you dying for.

120
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:39,930
Hey, Dirk, get your butt up here

121
00:14:40,122 --> 00:14:42,394
so we can scrape
some of the crap off this thing.

122
00:14:42,586 --> 00:14:44,185
- Excuse me. The wife.
- Come on, ladies,

123
00:14:44,377 --> 00:14:45,882
get Mr. Bateen unhooked.

124
00:14:46,234 --> 00:14:48,538
Clean him up.
We got a party to go to.

125
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,490
- Admiral?
- Retired.

126
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,474
- Jim Sandecker.
- Eva. Eva Rojas.

127
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,618
I'm with the WHO.

128
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,042
You look like you could use
a cup of coffee.

129
00:14:59,226 --> 00:15:01,050
- Hey, Dirk. Hey, I need your help.
- What?

130
00:15:01,242 --> 00:15:04,122
- Is it left over right, or right over left?
- This better not be like last time.

131
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:06,234
I can't remember.
It's driving me nuts.

132
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,882
Is there something about a rabbit
going around a tree or something?

133
00:15:10,074 --> 00:15:11,802
I'll be there in an hour.

134
00:15:12,698 --> 00:15:15,642
- What, Dirk?
- That was Oshodi.

135
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:18,938
He thinks he might
have found something.

136
00:15:19,354 --> 00:15:22,170
Oh, that's great. That is fantastic.

137
00:15:22,362 --> 00:15:25,690
- Thank you very much.
- No, no, no, no, fantastic for me.

138
00:15:25,882 --> 00:15:30,362
I can't wait to tell Sandecker that you're
not gonna be at the museum tonight

139
00:15:30,587 --> 00:15:33,050
because one of your contacts
from the Nigerian underworld

140
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,186
has found evidence of a Civil War
ironclad shipwrecked

141
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:38,586
- In a storm off Africa. Yeah, right.
- Storm off Africa.

142
00:15:38,778 --> 00:15:42,203
That's what you're talking about, right?
Yeah. Sandecker's gonna freak.

143
00:15:42,395 --> 00:15:44,858
- Look, Al...
- And I'll be there. He'll turn all red.

144
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:49,307
The fox chases the rabbit around
the tree and down the hole.

145
00:15:49,499 --> 00:15:52,922
That's how the tie works.
Don't you worry, I'll be there.

146
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:56,891
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

147
00:15:57,115 --> 00:16:01,339
First, I'd like to thank the Lagos
museum for this magnificent reception.

148
00:16:01,562 --> 00:16:03,098
I would also like to thank

149
00:16:03,323 --> 00:16:06,811
our primary benefactor on this project,
Yves Massarde.

150
00:16:07,355 --> 00:16:09,019
Thank you.

151
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:14,107
We are NUMA,

152
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,339
the National Underwater
and Marine Agency.

153
00:16:17,531 --> 00:16:20,795
And this, ladies and gentlemen,
is what we do.

154
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,083
King Bateen.

155
00:16:28,475 --> 00:16:29,979
- Where is he?
- He's not at the buffet.

156
00:16:30,171 --> 00:16:31,611
- Damn it.
- Do you want another kebab?

157
00:16:31,803 --> 00:16:34,843
With the help of museums,
with the help of governments,

158
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:38,363
private organizations like ours
can work in partnership

159
00:16:38,555 --> 00:16:39,963
to make sure that history,

160
00:16:40,155 --> 00:16:42,939
history that has been lost
to the tides of time,

161
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:46,363
can be returned to its people.
Thank you.

162
00:16:46,555 --> 00:16:48,763
Thank you so much.
Have a lovely evening.

163
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,084
Do you have a CD burner
on that ship of yours?

164
00:16:57,276 --> 00:17:00,156
Yes, the same one I bought
from you last month.

165
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:05,019
I have a wonderful piece, straight
from the Iraqi National Museum.

166
00:17:05,211 --> 00:17:07,995
Don't show me things like that,
Oshodi. We're not that friendly.

167
00:17:08,187 --> 00:17:12,060
Okay, okay. Now, here it is.

168
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:17,883
A very special piece.
The one I spoke to you about.

169
00:17:18,588 --> 00:17:22,460
It breaks my heart
just to show it to you.

170
00:17:29,403 --> 00:17:31,068
Where did you get this?

171
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,924
Cash, please.

172
00:17:34,107 --> 00:17:35,516
We are not that friendly.

173
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:54,108
This is a great party.

174
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,908
- Thank you for inviting us, admiral.
- The pleasure is mine.

175
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,244
Yves, this is the woman
I was telling you about,

176
00:18:01,436 --> 00:18:03,068
- Dr. Eva Rojas.
- Hi.

177
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:05,308
I'm delighted to make your
acquaintance. I'm Yves Massarde.

178
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,292
Nice to meet you.
This is Dr. Frank Hopper.

179
00:18:07,484 --> 00:18:08,764
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

180
00:18:08,989 --> 00:18:11,197
Yves does a lot of business
in Africa.

181
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:13,564
Some even in Mali.

182
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:16,573
Will you excuse me?

183
00:18:17,116 --> 00:18:21,148
I understand you believe there is some
sort of plague coming out of Mali?

184
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,909
We don't like to say "plague."

185
00:18:23,101 --> 00:18:24,892
- What do you think it is then?
- A plague.

186
00:18:25,597 --> 00:18:26,941
So you do business in Mali?

187
00:18:27,421 --> 00:18:29,245
Do you know anyone there
who could help us

188
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,580
by pressuring the WHO
to send a team?

189
00:18:31,772 --> 00:18:34,461
Well, you see, much of Mali
is controlled by a warlord.

190
00:18:34,653 --> 00:18:36,477
General Kazim. Do you know him?

191
00:18:36,765 --> 00:18:39,196
Yes. He used to be a colonel
in the Malian army,

192
00:18:39,388 --> 00:18:41,469
and gave himself an upgrade
the day he shot the president.

193
00:18:41,692 --> 00:18:43,581
He's the man who put the "war"
back into "warlord."

194
00:18:43,804 --> 00:18:45,085
And he controls the country?

195
00:18:45,277 --> 00:18:46,972
Half of it. And the other half
no one controls,

196
00:18:47,164 --> 00:18:48,700
but I don't know which is worse.

197
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:52,285
But I have to warn you, it is very
dangerous for foreigners right now.

198
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:54,621
I would say it's probably
more dangerous for locals.

199
00:18:54,813 --> 00:18:58,300
Yes, but your death would
look very bad in the papers.

200
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:00,221
So does the word "plague."

201
00:19:03,005 --> 00:19:06,461
All right, I will call some people,
but at the end of the day,

202
00:19:06,653 --> 00:19:09,693
I'm just a businessman,
so be patient.

203
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:11,773
Oh, yeah, she's good at that.

204
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:15,677
He's not gonna help us.
This was a waste of time.

205
00:19:15,869 --> 00:19:19,101
Eva, we can't just wander into
the middle of a Malian civil war.

206
00:19:19,293 --> 00:19:21,661
The fighting with the Tuaregs
is too severe. You know that.

207
00:19:21,885 --> 00:19:24,445
I think we should go back
to the hospital...

208
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:27,325
Admiral, have you ever seen
a Confederate gold dollar?

209
00:19:27,517 --> 00:19:29,342
- Dear God, don't start this again.
- Of course not.

210
00:19:29,534 --> 00:19:30,974
The Confederacy never made
a gold dollar.

211
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,702
The mint was destroyed
near the end of the war.

212
00:19:32,894 --> 00:19:34,718
Dirk, I beg you on my hands
and knees. Don't.

213
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,429
But not before Jefferson Davis
had five samples made.

214
00:19:38,621 --> 00:19:41,277
He gave four of those samples
to his top generals:

215
00:19:41,469 --> 00:19:44,414
- Lee, Jackson, Stuart and Johnston.
- Every time we come to Africa,

216
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:47,486
out comes that stupid ship model.
Out come the old port journals.

217
00:19:47,933 --> 00:19:49,821
We are leaving for Australia
tomorrow.

218
00:19:50,045 --> 00:19:51,581
Four of those samples
have been found.

219
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:54,590
But the fifth never was.

220
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:56,830
That one was given to
an old family friend of Davis.

221
00:19:57,022 --> 00:19:59,870
A brilliant young sea captain
named Mason Tombs.

222
00:20:00,062 --> 00:20:03,038
Captain of the CSS ironclad Texas.

223
00:20:05,501 --> 00:20:07,613
- Where in the hell did you get this?
- Frederick Oshodi.

224
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:09,118
And he got it from a man
named Indigwe.

225
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,574
But the important thing is that Indigwe
found this in Labbezanga, Mali.

226
00:20:12,766 --> 00:20:13,918
Hey, my dad collects coins.

227
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:17,534
No, that coin and the Texas
were on the Niger River.

228
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,094
It's impossible. An ironclad
couldn't make it with her draft.

229
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:22,366
Let me take the Calliope
to Labbezanga, have a look around.

230
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:24,734
- You can't have my boat, Dirk.
- Three days, admiral.

231
00:20:24,926 --> 00:20:27,038
Just three days. Imagine.

232
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,542
Imagine.

233
00:20:32,158 --> 00:20:33,854
All right, if I strike out,

234
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,254
you'll never hear another word
about this.

235
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,542
You got 72 hours.

236
00:20:41,278 --> 00:20:42,622
And not a nanosecond more.

237
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,054
You fellas just bought
yourself a boat trip.

238
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:47,871
You're a gentleman, admiral.
I don't care what they say about you.

239
00:20:48,063 --> 00:20:50,494
I got a bottle says we never find it.

240
00:20:51,615 --> 00:20:54,910
- Make it a case.
- All right. You're on.

241
00:21:18,815 --> 00:21:20,511
- Okay, I'll see you later.
- See you later.

242
00:21:21,471 --> 00:21:22,815
Hey, yo!

243
00:21:25,311 --> 00:21:27,006
- You're late.
- Excuse me?

244
00:21:27,198 --> 00:21:29,247
- I was told 8:00 departure.
- Eight o'clock?

245
00:21:29,439 --> 00:21:31,199
- I never said 8:00.
- I said 9.

246
00:21:31,391 --> 00:21:32,895
- Nine.
- It's after 1 0.

247
00:21:33,119 --> 00:21:34,206
Who said 8?

248
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,063
Admiral Sandecker.

249
00:21:36,255 --> 00:21:38,334
Yeah, he said to give him a call
if you had any problems.

250
00:21:38,526 --> 00:21:40,287
A problem? With what?

251
00:21:40,895 --> 00:21:43,327
He wants you to take us
up the river to Mali.

252
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:46,751
- What?
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

253
00:21:46,943 --> 00:21:49,919
- Taking you to Mali?
- Wait.

254
00:21:50,111 --> 00:21:51,807
There's been an outbreak in Mali.

255
00:21:51,999 --> 00:21:55,679
- It's going to become an epidemic.
- And you wanna hitch a ride, doctor?

256
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:58,335
What, WHO's making
budgetary cutbacks?

257
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,095
Please. It's important.

258
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:03,615
- You guys got enough gear?
- Probably not.

259
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,551
Small boat. No privacy.

260
00:22:12,095 --> 00:22:13,823
I'm not shy.

261
00:23:32,897 --> 00:23:34,241
Where do you call home?

262
00:23:34,433 --> 00:23:36,641
I have a house in Monterey,
but I'm never there.

263
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:39,168
Monterey. There's great diving
in Monterey.

264
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,568
Is that all you ever think about?
Diving?

265
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,665
No. Sometimes I think about
Petricola pholadiformis.

266
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:48,768
The angel wing clam.

267
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:51,456
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

268
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:53,888
This river's the only place
on earth they're found.

269
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,712
When they're underwater,
they glow in the dark.

270
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,529
Now, the amazing thing is that
modern science cannot explain why.

271
00:23:58,721 --> 00:24:00,128
There must be a reason.

272
00:24:00,961 --> 00:24:03,169
Till then, my theory is that
they do it because they can.

273
00:24:03,392 --> 00:24:05,696
Dirk! That's it. Let's go.

274
00:24:06,401 --> 00:24:07,873
Angel wings.

275
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:12,128
World would be a lot cooler place
if more of us were like that, huh?

276
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:28,193
This is the center of the cluster.
Here. Asselar.

277
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:30,049
That's where we have to go.

278
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,193
Right in the middle
of Kazim's civil war.

279
00:24:32,385 --> 00:24:34,753
Hey, you ever been
after marlins, doctors?

280
00:24:34,977 --> 00:24:37,057
Oh, no, not
the marlin story again, Al.

281
00:24:37,281 --> 00:24:39,649
Seven hundred
and thirty-three pounds.

282
00:24:39,841 --> 00:24:42,497
Five and a half hours
in the fighting chair.

283
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:45,633
- I thought it was 600 pounds.
- Hey!

284
00:24:45,825 --> 00:24:49,410
What did you catch that day?
I can't remember anything at all.

285
00:24:49,602 --> 00:24:51,105
How long you guys been together?

286
00:24:51,297 --> 00:24:54,913
Oh, since kindergarten.
College. Navy. NUMA.

287
00:24:55,105 --> 00:24:57,345
Poor guy's always
been in my shadow.

288
00:24:57,537 --> 00:25:00,066
Always the Al's-maid, never the Al.

289
00:25:00,258 --> 00:25:01,921
Right?

290
00:25:05,922 --> 00:25:08,001
Nice, doc.

291
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,889
You're pulling your weight.

292
00:25:11,874 --> 00:25:16,194
- My watch, chief.
- All right, my man. Excellent.

293
00:25:19,425 --> 00:25:24,225
Your friend Al told me all about
your Captain Tombs and his boat.

294
00:25:24,417 --> 00:25:26,018
Oh, he did, did he?

295
00:25:26,625 --> 00:25:29,666
He also said ironclads were
not made to cross the ocean.

296
00:25:29,858 --> 00:25:32,418
Well, neither was man. Tequila?

297
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,986
And you found a coin?

298
00:25:41,314 --> 00:25:42,818
Not just a coin.

299
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,690
I found the coin.

300
00:25:47,458 --> 00:25:49,698
Now, I also have a letter
from the captain's widow

301
00:25:49,890 --> 00:25:53,058
alluding to her husband's
urgent Eastern voyage.

302
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,266
I have a sailor's log
on an Atlantic clipper

303
00:25:55,458 --> 00:25:58,082
who swears on a stack of Bibles
he saw a great iron beast

304
00:25:58,274 --> 00:26:00,642
steaming two miles
off the African coast.

305
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:05,954
Now, what kind of man tries to take
a ship like that across the ocean?

306
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:09,379
Why? How?

307
00:26:09,763 --> 00:26:11,330
I don't know.

308
00:26:11,554 --> 00:26:12,994
But I plan on finding out.

309
00:26:17,443 --> 00:26:20,834
Al loves it when people ask me that,
thinks it makes me look a bit:

310
00:26:30,626 --> 00:26:32,386
This must be nice.

311
00:26:33,507 --> 00:26:35,107
To have this as your office.

312
00:26:36,994 --> 00:26:38,755
Well, every great thing that's ever
happened to me

313
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:40,450
happened in the water.

314
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:44,355
Every one.

315
00:26:55,522 --> 00:26:57,795
Hey, Rudi, come on,
help me out with this.

316
00:26:58,307 --> 00:26:59,875
Oumar.

317
00:27:00,387 --> 00:27:02,115
- You got it?
- There you go.

318
00:27:02,307 --> 00:27:05,571
- How long to Asselar?
- Oh, six, eight hours. No problem.

319
00:27:05,763 --> 00:27:07,459
- You stay for long?
- No, not long.

320
00:27:07,651 --> 00:27:09,123
All right, this one too.

321
00:27:09,315 --> 00:27:11,779
- Think it'll be safe?
- Oh, it's okay.

322
00:27:11,971 --> 00:27:14,915
Where we go now,
no fighting. No problem.

323
00:27:15,139 --> 00:27:17,699
- Yeah, no problem.
- No Tuareg.

324
00:27:19,171 --> 00:27:21,539
Listen, I've been thinking.

325
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:24,547
When this is over,
there's a place I know.

326
00:27:24,739 --> 00:27:26,595
It's called Monterey.

327
00:27:26,883 --> 00:27:28,931
- Never heard of it.
- No?

328
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:31,203
It's got a beautiful beach.

329
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:34,532
Golden sands, aqua-blue surf.
The place is paradise.

330
00:27:34,724 --> 00:27:36,099
- Sounds good.
- Oh, yeah.

331
00:27:36,963 --> 00:27:40,355
I also happen to know a woman
who has a house there.

332
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:44,163
And because she's a workaholic,
she's never at home.

333
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:47,235
Now, I haven't asked her, but I'm
pretty sure that she wouldn't mind

334
00:27:47,459 --> 00:27:48,515
if you dropped by.

335
00:27:48,963 --> 00:27:50,147
Can I bring a friend?

336
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:53,284
You'd have to ask her.

337
00:27:53,476 --> 00:27:55,331
I already did.

338
00:27:56,195 --> 00:27:57,700
You did?

339
00:27:59,075 --> 00:28:01,187
You, me and the bay of Monterey.

340
00:28:03,044 --> 00:28:04,451
Thank you for everything.

341
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,308
- You're welcome.
- And good luck to you.

342
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,476
You as well. Bonne route, doctor.

343
00:28:26,276 --> 00:28:28,452
Mr. Indigwe, he lives...

344
00:28:32,164 --> 00:28:34,628
Indigwe. He find this
one week before, yes?

345
00:28:41,316 --> 00:28:45,093
You know, I'm not
too much of a linguist...

346
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:47,205
...but that didn't sound too good.

347
00:28:47,716 --> 00:28:49,476
Indigwe is dead.

348
00:28:52,644 --> 00:28:54,532
Yeah. Hey, the check.

349
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,093
What is "the check"? L'addition,

350
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:07,749
Hey, you know, my dad
collected ancient coins.

351
00:29:07,941 --> 00:29:12,036
From Rome, China, Siam, Persia.

352
00:29:12,228 --> 00:29:15,396
Somehow they all ended up
in a shoebox in New Jersey.

353
00:29:16,932 --> 00:29:19,845
- Meaning?
- Coins travel, Dirk.

354
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:24,197
Even if that poor guy was still alive,
it could have been nothing.

355
00:29:25,476 --> 00:29:28,356
Yeah, but the coin traveled
from somewhere, Al.

356
00:29:28,581 --> 00:29:30,756
And unless it hitched a ride
on the back of a dolphin,

357
00:29:30,948 --> 00:29:32,484
I'm gonna guess that
its jumping-off point

358
00:29:32,676 --> 00:29:34,917
was a little bit closer
to where we're sitting.

359
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:40,613
Really, you can see that ironclad
steaming up the river? I mean, really?

360
00:29:40,805 --> 00:29:44,293
Isn't it more likely that we missed it
somewhere off the coast of Virginia?

361
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:47,685
Right?

362
00:29:49,157 --> 00:29:50,629
Hello?

363
00:29:52,069 --> 00:29:53,445
Dirk.

364
00:29:55,333 --> 00:29:57,221
I'll meet you at the boat.

365
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:03,205
No, I got the check.

366
00:30:03,397 --> 00:30:05,413
Don't worry about it. I'm serious.

367
00:30:05,605 --> 00:30:07,013
I know, I get it all the time.

368
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,693
Sit down, I'll get the check.
L'addition,

369
00:31:03,366 --> 00:31:05,062
Ya-Sheikh.

370
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:07,110
My name is Dirk.

371
00:31:09,062 --> 00:31:10,726
I'm looking for a boat.

372
00:31:13,318 --> 00:31:15,558
And when would we be
seeing this boat?

373
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:19,814
About 140 years ago, in 1866.

374
00:31:20,006 --> 00:31:23,462
Back when Labbezanga was
one of the greatest ports in Africa.

375
00:31:23,654 --> 00:31:25,031
Do you know anything else?

376
00:31:25,223 --> 00:31:28,934
We use events to find dates,
not dates to find events.

377
00:31:29,735 --> 00:31:31,878
Well, there was a storm.

378
00:31:32,231 --> 00:31:33,894
There was a great storm.

379
00:31:34,118 --> 00:31:36,167
One that would have raised
the depths of the Niger

380
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:39,014
enough to allow the boat
to get here, yes.

381
00:31:46,727 --> 00:31:48,966
It is written here.

382
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,166
Six days after the great storm,

383
00:31:52,391 --> 00:31:57,895
a dark ship rode without sails
under the banner of a single star.

384
00:31:58,535 --> 00:32:02,630
It was driven upriver,
never to return.

385
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,934
Bearing...

386
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:07,303
...death.

387
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,174
It brought a sickness
from here up to Gao

388
00:32:11,911 --> 00:32:15,815
and bore over 300 souls to heaven.

389
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:18,919
It was believed a damnation
from Allah.

390
00:32:19,527 --> 00:32:21,351
A ghost ship.

391
00:32:21,543 --> 00:32:23,463
A cursed ship.

392
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:33,063
What does that mean?

393
00:32:43,143 --> 00:32:44,839
- What?
- That's Arabic, Al.

394
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,536
Yeah. Sounds poetic.
What's it mean?

395
00:32:46,728 --> 00:32:48,456
"The ship of death."

396
00:32:48,648 --> 00:32:50,568
Great. Should we call Sandecker?

397
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,647
- No.
- What ship? Whose death?

398
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:54,120
He'd just tell us to come home.

399
00:32:54,312 --> 00:32:56,679
- Sounds reasonable.
- Yeah, then I'd get a case of tequila.

400
00:32:56,871 --> 00:32:58,855
Boys, we are going upriver to Gao.

401
00:32:59,047 --> 00:33:02,280
All right. Rudi, you gonna run
the sonar on the riverbed?

402
00:33:02,472 --> 00:33:04,999
Come on, I was hoping to meet
a girl on the Australia trip.

403
00:33:05,191 --> 00:33:07,527
No, African war zone. Ship of death.

404
00:33:12,711 --> 00:33:14,439
Bye.

405
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:42,152
- Got a profile.
- Another truck bumper?

406
00:33:42,792 --> 00:33:44,072
Bicycle? VCR?

407
00:33:44,264 --> 00:33:47,400
Sixteen degrees, twenty-decimal-zero
minutes north, zero...

408
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,184
Wait, hold on. It's just
some interference with the buoy.

409
00:33:50,376 --> 00:33:52,104
- Al.
- Yeah, I got it.

410
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:53,544
When did you check the calibration?

411
00:33:53,736 --> 00:33:55,176
I had it out of the water
three hours ago.

412
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,808
All right.

413
00:33:58,824 --> 00:34:01,096
- Anything, Al?
- Hey, guys.

414
00:34:01,288 --> 00:34:03,656
Take a look at this.

415
00:34:08,137 --> 00:34:09,961
It's red algae.

416
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,937
That doesn't make any sense,
this is fresh water.

417
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:14,953
- I'd better get a sample.
- Yep.

418
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:34,537
It's okay, they're just looking
for Tuareg fighters.

419
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:07,177
Very well, thank you.

420
00:35:07,753 --> 00:35:09,513
For you.

421
00:35:11,497 --> 00:35:12,905
Join me.

422
00:35:13,161 --> 00:35:14,889
Thank you.

423
00:35:17,097 --> 00:35:20,361
These belonged
to General Mayenne.

424
00:35:22,442 --> 00:35:25,673
Then one of them actually killed
the Comte de Vezelay.

425
00:35:26,601 --> 00:35:29,289
Isn't that fascinating?

426
00:35:30,506 --> 00:35:33,225
Beads for the natives, Yves.

427
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,690
What do you want?

428
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:40,137
Well, you know the doctors
I was telling you about?

429
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:43,785
I am afraid they're
on their way to Mali.

430
00:35:45,417 --> 00:35:47,529
I thought your man was going
to take care of them in Lagos.

431
00:35:47,753 --> 00:35:50,314
- Well, we had a problem.
- And now the problem is mine.

432
00:35:55,562 --> 00:35:58,186
And another thing, general,
if I may say,

433
00:35:58,793 --> 00:36:02,570
I am slightly concerned
your measures of containment

434
00:36:02,762 --> 00:36:04,234
are losing their effectiveness.

435
00:36:04,426 --> 00:36:07,690
Why? Because five or six poor souls
escaped from Mali

436
00:36:07,882 --> 00:36:10,217
- And died in their beds?
- The disease spreads quickly.

437
00:36:10,409 --> 00:36:13,482
And luckily, it kills quickly too.

438
00:36:14,602 --> 00:36:19,050
General, I think you should control
the movements of your population.

439
00:36:19,306 --> 00:36:20,362
What's that?

440
00:36:21,578 --> 00:36:24,426
Are you trying to tell me
how to run my country?

441
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,018
You take care
of your business, Yves.

442
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,066
I'll take care of mine.

443
00:36:29,706 --> 00:36:31,210
Of course.

444
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:33,098
- Rocks?
- Nope.

445
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:36,618
- River? Radio?
- Nope.

446
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,210
- Radar?
- Rudi.

447
00:36:39,402 --> 00:36:40,682
- You... That's not...
- It is.

448
00:36:40,874 --> 00:36:42,699
- He can't even...
- Here we go again. I spy.

449
00:36:42,891 --> 00:36:46,347
- All right, something I might get.
- I spy...

450
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,874
- I spy with my little eye...
- Guys.

451
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:53,578
- Company.
- This is the Malian Civil Authority.

452
00:36:53,802 --> 00:36:55,786
- I got it.
- Prepare to be boarded.

453
00:36:56,010 --> 00:36:58,026
You are trespassing
in Malian waters.

454
00:36:58,218 --> 00:36:59,658
Shut off your engine
and throw out a rope.

455
00:36:59,883 --> 00:37:02,218
Hi, this is Al Giordino speaking.

456
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:05,259
Al, Sandecker. I presume you're on
your way home with my boat?

457
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:07,083
- Everyone on deck, right now.
- It's for you.

458
00:37:07,275 --> 00:37:09,162
- Al, what's going on?
- Where are the doctors?

459
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:11,370
Where are they? We are looking
for the doctors.

460
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,219
I have to put you on hold. I don't
believe this is a normal shakedown, Al.

461
00:37:14,411 --> 00:37:18,731
If you do not shut off your engine,
you run the risk of being fired upon.

462
00:37:18,923 --> 00:37:21,291
The doctors. We are looking
for the doctors. Where are they?

463
00:37:21,483 --> 00:37:24,042
- Where is the woman?
- I'm sorry. I don't speak English.

464
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,995
You are speaking English now.

465
00:37:26,187 --> 00:37:29,483
No, no. I only know how to say,
"I don't speak English," in English.

466
00:37:31,755 --> 00:37:34,347
- Al.
- Hi. Hold on.

467
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,547
Stop! Stop the engines now
before we open fire.

468
00:37:41,355 --> 00:37:42,411
Whoa, hat!

469
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:49,963
- Did you get my hat?
- Sorry, it's gone.

470
00:37:50,667 --> 00:37:52,043
That's my favorite hat.

471
00:38:04,715 --> 00:38:06,988
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

472
00:38:07,564 --> 00:38:10,603
- Where's Dirk?
- I think he's...

473
00:38:21,707 --> 00:38:23,020
Hold on.

474
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:58,508
Dirk! Dirk.

475
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:10,508
I'm gonna come in.
You jump on the front.

476
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,452
- You want me to jump?
- Get on the front of the boat. Got it?

477
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:15,468
- Really?
- What am I...?

478
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,805
- Al!
- What?

479
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,052
Here, flare gun.

480
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:33,420
- Signal for help?
- No, shoot them.

481
00:39:42,188 --> 00:39:43,500
- Hey!
- Sorry.

482
00:39:47,245 --> 00:39:48,653
Come a little closer, babe. Come.

483
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:56,717
Oh, yeah!

484
00:40:16,813 --> 00:40:18,221
That is what I'm talking about.

485
00:40:46,285 --> 00:40:48,781
- Are you all right?
- That was close.

486
00:40:48,973 --> 00:40:50,349
- Al, pick up the phone,
- Yeah, it was.

487
00:40:50,541 --> 00:40:51,949
- How about you?
- Pick up the phone,

488
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:53,550
- Glad I'm driving.
- Still there?

489
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,341
- I am too.
- What the hell is going on?

490
00:40:55,533 --> 00:40:56,941
I shot a guy with a flare gun.

491
00:40:57,133 --> 00:40:58,893
- A flare gun? What?
- Cool.

492
00:40:59,085 --> 00:40:59,565
What did you... ? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

493
00:40:59,629 --> 00:41:02,029
What did you... ? Did you say you
shot someone with a flare gun?

494
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:03,789
- What?
- Who?

495
00:41:06,926 --> 00:41:07,917
Don't put the phone...

496
00:41:10,605 --> 00:41:12,014
Rudi?

497
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:24,110
Who's shooting? Al, who's shooting?
Is someone shooting at you?

498
00:41:24,494 --> 00:41:25,710
You'd better not hurt my boat,

499
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,557
Engine two is out.

500
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:31,118
Fourth and long, man.
What do you wanna do?

501
00:41:33,870 --> 00:41:37,806
- I think we need to pull a Panama.
- A Panama. A Panama?!

502
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:40,526
- Panama?
- You think? Really?

503
00:41:40,750 --> 00:41:42,286
- Yeah. Really.
- No Panama,

504
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:45,806
Somebody pick up... They're
ignoring me. They're ignoring...

505
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:48,078
Everybody's ignoring me.
Pick up the phone!

506
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:50,094
Take it. We're doing a Panama.
We're doing a Panama!

507
00:41:50,286 --> 00:41:51,662
- What's a Panama?
- Navy thing.

508
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:54,414
- I didn't know you were in Panama.
- Weren't. We were in Nicaragua.

509
00:41:54,862 --> 00:41:57,678
- Then why do you call it a Panama?
- We thought we were in Panama.

510
00:41:57,870 --> 00:42:00,238
No Panama,

511
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,950
What are you looking for? Al!

512
00:42:14,671 --> 00:42:17,198
Al. Al, I'm really confused.

513
00:42:24,782 --> 00:42:26,830
How we doing, Al?

514
00:42:27,694 --> 00:42:29,103
- Go help Dirk.
- What do I do with this?

515
00:42:29,326 --> 00:42:30,543
Just go!

516
00:42:31,279 --> 00:42:32,431
Down.

517
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,783
- Open the engine hatch.
- Okay.

518
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:40,111
Let's go, Al.

519
00:42:44,815 --> 00:42:46,222
Got it.

520
00:42:47,470 --> 00:42:49,359
Here, light this.

521
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:52,975
- Aren't these the admiral's?
- Just light it.

522
00:43:01,583 --> 00:43:03,279
What the...?

523
00:43:03,663 --> 00:43:05,007
Whenever you're ready, Al.

524
00:43:05,199 --> 00:43:07,023
- Come on!
- What are we doing?

525
00:43:07,727 --> 00:43:10,287
- I don't think you should be doing that.
- Okay. Drop it.

526
00:43:10,479 --> 00:43:12,591
- We're good.
- Yeah?

527
00:43:12,783 --> 00:43:14,191
- All right, hold on.
- Hold on.

528
00:43:14,415 --> 00:43:15,791
Okay.

529
00:43:20,399 --> 00:43:21,615
Al!

530
00:43:30,063 --> 00:43:31,439
Hey, I need a life jacket.

531
00:43:49,775 --> 00:43:51,311
Crap.

532
00:43:51,536 --> 00:43:53,423
He did a Panama.

533
00:43:54,352 --> 00:43:55,504
He did a Panama.

534
00:43:57,328 --> 00:43:58,768
Cool.

535
00:43:58,991 --> 00:44:01,648
- Is that how it worked the first time?
- Well...

536
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,559
...it didn't really work
the first time.

537
00:44:06,736 --> 00:44:09,104
- I lost my hat.
- Again?

538
00:44:09,328 --> 00:44:10,480
Yeah.

539
00:44:21,616 --> 00:44:23,024
Man, is Sandecker gonna be mad

540
00:44:23,216 --> 00:44:25,392
when you tell him
you lost the satellite phone.

541
00:44:25,584 --> 00:44:28,208
Not as mad as when Rudi tells him
it was attached to the boat.

542
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,248
- Wait. Why me?
- Because we're not going back.

543
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,360
- Right, Dirk?
- Nope. We're going to Asselar.

544
00:44:33,584 --> 00:44:37,040
- No more Texas?
- Ironclad's on hold for a while, guys.

545
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:39,792
Those soldiers weren't after us.
They were after the doctors.

546
00:44:39,984 --> 00:44:42,960
I got a feeling whatever bug
Eva's chasing, it must be a doozy.

547
00:44:43,152 --> 00:44:45,009
- We gotta get there first.
- I'm going with you.

548
00:44:45,201 --> 00:44:47,088
- Nope, you gotta tell Sandecker.
- Hold on. Hold on.

549
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,001
How am I gonna get across the border?
I never took survival training.

550
00:44:50,224 --> 00:44:52,305
- Consider this your course.
- It's kind of pass-fail,

551
00:44:52,528 --> 00:44:53,937
which I always thought was easier.

552
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:57,744
Look, Rudi. Lay up here till dark, then
make your move. The border's not far.

553
00:44:57,936 --> 00:44:59,217
- Okay.
- All right.

554
00:45:00,624 --> 00:45:03,376
Al, you remember
that time in Morocco?

555
00:45:03,568 --> 00:45:06,641
Oh, yeah, when you made me ride
that damn camel

556
00:45:06,833 --> 00:45:10,128
- That bit my ass.
- Yeah, that's the time.

557
00:45:11,313 --> 00:45:12,720
Why?

558
00:45:20,465 --> 00:45:23,568
God! What is the secret
to this thing?

559
00:45:23,793 --> 00:45:26,160
Just wrap it around your nugget.

560
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:30,449
- What part? Here? This?
- Yeah.

561
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:34,385
Well, how come yours stays on?

562
00:45:34,993 --> 00:45:36,625
Maybe you got a small head.

563
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:41,073
I don't think so.
Somebody would've told me.

564
00:46:04,913 --> 00:46:06,481
Thank you.

565
00:46:11,441 --> 00:46:13,169
World Health Organization.

566
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:15,154
Hello?

567
00:46:15,505 --> 00:46:17,362
Is anyone here?

568
00:46:22,961 --> 00:46:24,370
Frank.

569
00:46:24,946 --> 00:46:26,641
Look at this.

570
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:42,642
Anyone here?

571
00:46:48,946 --> 00:46:50,610
Hello?

572
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:56,434
Hello?

573
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:12,946
Oh, my God.

574
00:48:26,163 --> 00:48:28,851
This well was filled in recently.

575
00:48:29,043 --> 00:48:31,411
I think people here knew
the water was making them sick.

576
00:48:31,603 --> 00:48:34,099
I still say we should
let Oumar go down.

577
00:48:34,291 --> 00:48:36,531
Oumar, you wouldn't mind
going down that well, would you?

578
00:48:36,755 --> 00:48:38,163
- No, it's okay. I'll go down.
- You see?

579
00:48:38,388 --> 00:48:40,116
Frank, I'll be fine.

580
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,987
Yeah, there you go.

581
00:48:53,683 --> 00:48:56,659
All right, you're looking good.
You're looking good.

582
00:48:57,204 --> 00:48:59,316
- Give her a little more rope.
- Okay.

583
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,891
Be careful, please.

584
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:06,612
Just take your time.

585
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:08,115
Eva.

586
00:49:08,724 --> 00:49:09,908
Eva, hold on.

587
00:49:10,932 --> 00:49:13,268
Eva. Hold on. We've got you.

588
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:14,547
- You got it?
- It's okay.

589
00:49:15,603 --> 00:49:18,099
- Bring her up.
- No, I'm fine.

590
00:49:18,771 --> 00:49:20,052
Give me more rope.

591
00:49:26,996 --> 00:49:29,492
Got it. I made it.

592
00:49:41,844 --> 00:49:43,956
- Got water.
- All right, great.

593
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:46,324
Get what we need,
and let's get you out of there.

594
00:49:46,964 --> 00:49:49,556
Hey, looks like we've got company.

595
00:49:50,836 --> 00:49:52,980
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

596
00:49:53,172 --> 00:49:54,388
Okay.

597
00:49:54,580 --> 00:49:56,820
Hello there. I'm Dr. Hopper with
the World Health Organization.

598
00:49:57,013 --> 00:49:59,764
- You have no authority to be here.
- What are you doing?

599
00:49:59,956 --> 00:50:02,293
Eva, get those... Oh, my God!

600
00:50:03,412 --> 00:50:05,236
- Frank!
- Charlie, please don't shoot me.

601
00:50:05,557 --> 00:50:07,093
Charlie, don't...

602
00:50:33,364 --> 00:50:35,668
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
do you hear that?

603
00:50:57,621 --> 00:50:59,381
- This is all of them?
- Yes, sir.

604
00:51:00,789 --> 00:51:05,525
The UN knows that we're here. This is
a United Nations-sanctioned mission.

605
00:51:09,141 --> 00:51:10,293
Where's your colleague?

606
00:51:13,365 --> 00:51:15,221
No, no, no, no, no.

607
00:51:15,413 --> 00:51:17,397
I mean, the woman.

608
00:51:19,670 --> 00:51:22,262
She didn't come. She's ill.

609
00:51:24,021 --> 00:51:28,310
This pistol, it belonged
to General Sir Henry Watkins.

610
00:51:28,533 --> 00:51:31,733
.455 caliber. Very rare.

611
00:51:32,117 --> 00:51:34,613
Hard to find the rounds.

612
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:39,573
I have them made
by Holland and Holland of London.

613
00:51:41,942 --> 00:51:45,749
Twenty-seven pounds each.

614
00:51:47,254 --> 00:51:49,654
You should put the money
to better use.

615
00:51:51,221 --> 00:51:52,630
Like containing this plague.

616
00:52:07,862 --> 00:52:09,270
I will give you some advice.

617
00:52:10,838 --> 00:52:13,526
Tell me where Dr. Rojas is.

618
00:52:14,326 --> 00:52:16,182
She's not here.

619
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:19,702
Have it your own way.

620
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:34,934
Make it look like a horde of Tuareg
swine just came through here.

621
00:52:35,702 --> 00:52:37,174
- And find the woman.
- Yes, sir.

622
00:52:37,398 --> 00:52:38,614
She's here.

623
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,271
Somewhere.

624
00:53:13,494 --> 00:53:15,030
You men, set up a perimeter.

625
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:17,334
I want you to search
the whole town.

626
00:53:17,879 --> 00:53:21,335
- Hey, Salim, come over here.
- Yes, sir.

627
00:53:48,503 --> 00:53:51,575
Open up a few rounds
just to be sure.

628
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:58,936
Hey.

629
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,224
Al, little help here.

630
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,456
Oh, man.

631
00:55:53,624 --> 00:55:55,640
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, Eva.

632
00:56:00,217 --> 00:56:01,592
Come on. You okay?

633
00:56:01,784 --> 00:56:03,577
- Yeah.
- Come on.

634
00:56:04,921 --> 00:56:06,681
We gotta go.

635
00:56:07,673 --> 00:56:10,073
Wait. Wait!

636
00:56:11,001 --> 00:56:12,665
Frank!

637
00:56:13,721 --> 00:56:15,129
Frank!

638
00:56:19,929 --> 00:56:21,625
We're done here.

639
00:56:43,897 --> 00:56:46,617
We're in Tuareg country now.

640
00:56:47,385 --> 00:56:51,129
We're gonna drive north about
three hours till we hit the flatlands.

641
00:56:51,321 --> 00:56:55,161
From there it should be a relatively
easy drive to the Algerian border.

642
00:56:56,089 --> 00:56:57,817
Sorry.

643
00:56:58,905 --> 00:57:00,345
Eva.

644
00:57:02,394 --> 00:57:04,026
Eva.

645
00:57:07,065 --> 00:57:09,242
We'll get through, huh?

646
00:57:14,874 --> 00:57:16,634
- This way.
- Please tell me what I am doing here.

647
00:57:16,826 --> 00:57:20,282
Five men shot dead in cold blood.
What do you think about that?

648
00:57:20,474 --> 00:57:22,713
Hardly my responsibility.

649
00:57:22,905 --> 00:57:24,698
No, no, no, you sit, you sit.

650
00:57:24,890 --> 00:57:26,778
You are a very brave man.

651
00:57:27,002 --> 00:57:28,250
The only survivor.

652
00:57:28,442 --> 00:57:30,714
Crawled all the way from Asselar
to bring me the news.

653
00:57:30,906 --> 00:57:33,754
- How very commendable.
- Caught in a classic Tuareg ambush,

654
00:57:33,946 --> 00:57:35,802
- Wouldn't you say?
- Possibly.

655
00:57:35,994 --> 00:57:39,610
One problem.
There were no Tuareg.

656
00:57:56,251 --> 00:57:59,899
Why didn't you tell me the doctors
had American military support?

657
00:58:00,091 --> 00:58:03,451
- Because they didn't.
- The two unarmed men who did this...

658
00:58:04,603 --> 00:58:08,314
...they were not amateurs, Yves.
Nor were the ones on the boat.

659
00:58:08,506 --> 00:58:11,354
- And they're the same men, I think.
- They're treasure hunters, general.

660
00:58:11,578 --> 00:58:13,178
Marine salvage, they call themselves.

661
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:17,338
- Hardly your military elite.
- Don't underestimate them.

662
00:58:17,818 --> 00:58:22,011
Watch out. And if you find them,
bring them to me.

663
00:58:49,051 --> 00:58:50,939
What is it?

664
00:58:54,491 --> 00:58:55,643
Get out of the Jeep.

665
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,299
Keep your hands up.

666
00:58:58,491 --> 00:59:00,443
Move slowly.

667
00:59:22,235 --> 00:59:23,547
What?

668
00:59:35,516 --> 00:59:36,668
Three o'clock.

669
01:00:04,379 --> 01:00:05,628
Tuaregs!

670
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:10,108
Hi. How are you?

671
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:51,837
Al, did you see that?
No, hang on a minute.

672
01:01:12,477 --> 01:01:13,853
Who are you...

673
01:01:14,844 --> 01:01:16,668
...and why are you here?

674
01:01:17,436 --> 01:01:19,517
We are enemies of Kazim.

675
01:01:20,925 --> 01:01:22,620
You are American.

676
01:01:25,661 --> 01:01:26,749
CIA?

677
01:01:28,509 --> 01:01:30,269
No.

678
01:01:34,589 --> 01:01:36,989
I'm a doctor from
the World Health Organization.

679
01:01:38,589 --> 01:01:41,213
I'm investigating the source
of a disease.

680
01:01:48,893 --> 01:01:50,941
Come with me.

681
01:02:00,829 --> 01:02:03,197
This is the disease
you are looking for?

682
01:02:07,741 --> 01:02:09,373
I believe it is.

683
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:19,902
All right. Ready to go, big D, big D.

684
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:50,558
It's not a plague.

685
01:02:50,750 --> 01:02:53,310
- What?
- It's not a plague. It's a poison.

686
01:02:53,502 --> 01:02:55,294
There are toxins in the water,
here and in Asselar.

687
01:02:55,486 --> 01:02:56,414
- Toxins?
- Yes.

688
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:58,654
That's what's making
these people sick.

689
01:03:00,286 --> 01:03:01,726
Can you treat it?

690
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,214
No.

691
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:11,102
- Admiral, what can I do for you?
- What do you hear from Mali?

692
01:03:11,294 --> 01:03:14,622
- Beautiful country.
- Oh, kiss my ass.

693
01:03:14,846 --> 01:03:18,719
I hear about a couple of
American boys and their fancy yacht

694
01:03:18,942 --> 01:03:21,311
getting in some trouble on the Niger.

695
01:03:21,534 --> 01:03:22,847
Does the agency have
a presence there?

696
01:03:23,039 --> 01:03:24,926
No, it's strictly hands-off.

697
01:03:25,118 --> 01:03:26,430
- Carl.
- What?

698
01:03:26,622 --> 01:03:28,415
I gotta get my boys out.

699
01:03:28,607 --> 01:03:30,942
They're private citizens.
Now, if they choose to go down there

700
01:03:31,134 --> 01:03:33,438
and get themselves shot up
over some sunken treasure,

701
01:03:33,662 --> 01:03:35,582
that is not a company problem.

702
01:03:35,838 --> 01:03:38,047
- I'm not asking the company.
- Yeah.

703
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,902
You've got some nerve.

704
01:03:40,094 --> 01:03:41,503
Come down here
compromising my cover,

705
01:03:41,695 --> 01:03:44,735
and now you're gonna ask me to risk
my whole career over this nonsense?

706
01:03:44,927 --> 01:03:48,062
Well, since you put it that way...

707
01:03:48,254 --> 01:03:49,982
...yes, I am.
- No, you're not,

708
01:03:50,174 --> 01:03:52,415
because I'm not gonna do it.

709
01:03:52,958 --> 01:03:55,391
I'm not gonna do it.

710
01:03:56,798 --> 01:04:00,991
October 27th, 1982.

711
01:04:01,886 --> 01:04:05,567
- Yeah, I knew you'd bring that up.
- And now I have.

712
01:04:13,343 --> 01:04:15,647
- If I do this, we are even.
- The slate's clean.

713
01:04:15,679 --> 01:04:17,407
- If I do this, we are even.
- The slate's clean.

714
01:04:19,615 --> 01:04:21,759
I'll see what I can do.

715
01:04:23,135 --> 01:04:24,639
Always a pleasure, my friend.

716
01:04:27,775 --> 01:04:30,335
Benzine, heavy metals, nitrates,

717
01:04:30,527 --> 01:04:33,823
Basically, the water's toxic.

718
01:04:37,215 --> 01:04:38,943
I understand.

719
01:04:40,287 --> 01:04:43,231
But Kazim's men followed your trail.

720
01:04:44,064 --> 01:04:47,424
You must leave tomorrow
at first light.

721
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,711
Modibo.

722
01:04:52,128 --> 01:04:54,912
Eva found the same poison
in the wells at Asselar.

723
01:04:55,104 --> 01:04:59,391
- It's over 300 miles from here.
- Africa will find a place for us.

724
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:01,952
Modibo...

725
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:04,064
...we have to find the source.

726
01:05:04,287 --> 01:05:06,015
That is for you.

727
01:05:06,207 --> 01:05:08,576
My duty is here with my people.

728
01:05:13,248 --> 01:05:15,168
We leave in the morning.

729
01:05:16,128 --> 01:05:19,200
I've heard that my car
pleases your eyes.

730
01:05:23,776 --> 01:05:26,912
It's a 1936 Avions Voisin.

731
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:29,120
Six cylinders, sleeve-valve engine.

732
01:05:29,312 --> 01:05:32,224
Do you know there was only
six of these ever made?

733
01:05:33,728 --> 01:05:36,832
- How the hell did you get it?
- We borrowed it...

734
01:05:38,208 --> 01:05:39,776
...from Kazim.

735
01:05:46,016 --> 01:05:48,672
Bye. Thank you.

736
01:05:48,864 --> 01:05:51,136
Okay, ready? I'll do it. I'll do it.

737
01:05:51,328 --> 01:05:54,976
Okay, here we go. Come on.
New Al record right here.

738
01:06:25,984 --> 01:06:27,201
I got something you gotta see.

739
01:06:27,393 --> 01:06:28,768
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

740
01:06:28,960 --> 01:06:30,529
- All right, give me a minute.
- Come on!

741
01:06:35,233 --> 01:06:37,953
That is your Texas we're looking at,
isn't it?

742
01:06:38,145 --> 01:06:39,873
- Sure the hell looks like it.
- Yeah.

743
01:06:40,065 --> 01:06:42,177
- Sitting in the middle of the desert.
- Yep.

744
01:06:42,369 --> 01:06:45,281
Hey, I am not paying off the tequila
on a picture, okay?

745
01:06:45,537 --> 01:06:48,641
Ship of the desert's a camel.
It's not an ironclad battleship.

746
01:06:48,865 --> 01:06:51,649
I mean, there is no way that
that could get across the desert.

747
01:06:51,841 --> 01:06:54,689
At one time, much of this desert
was lush, green farmland,

748
01:06:54,913 --> 01:06:57,281
and there were rivers everywhere.

749
01:06:57,921 --> 01:07:00,513
Now, the ironclad obviously
came up this river

750
01:07:00,705 --> 01:07:04,417
and stopped at this structure,
which is a fort? A castle? I don't know.

751
01:07:04,865 --> 01:07:06,017
So the climate changed.

752
01:07:06,209 --> 01:07:08,577
So let's say the water level dropped,
and the boat became stranded.

753
01:07:08,801 --> 01:07:10,754
Yeah, or sailed away.

754
01:07:10,977 --> 01:07:13,889
Or the land dried up,
the soil turned to dust,

755
01:07:14,114 --> 01:07:15,617
the sands blew in,

756
01:07:15,842 --> 01:07:19,425
and the ship is still buried
to this day...

757
01:07:20,289 --> 01:07:23,234
...right here, next to the structure.
- Okay, great.

758
01:07:23,489 --> 01:07:26,049
So all we have to do is wait
for the river to fill up again

759
01:07:26,241 --> 01:07:27,650
and sail the Texas home.

760
01:07:29,249 --> 01:07:30,689
- That's how it's spreading.
- What is?

761
01:07:30,914 --> 01:07:31,841
The toxins.

762
01:07:32,066 --> 01:07:33,953
What, in the dried-up,
nonexistent river?

763
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:38,242
No, no, no. The same river that was on
the surface 150 years ago still exists.

764
01:07:38,434 --> 01:07:40,258
It's just beneath our feet now,
sunk in the sand,

765
01:07:40,450 --> 01:07:42,209
running along the rock strata.

766
01:07:42,401 --> 01:07:44,354
Now, the toxins are obviously leeching
from their source

767
01:07:44,578 --> 01:07:46,370
into the underground river system.

768
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:49,730
- Spreading from well to well.
- Exactly.

769
01:07:50,273 --> 01:07:54,113
So we find your Texas,
we find the underground river.

770
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,145
We find the river,
we find the source of the toxins.

771
01:08:04,066 --> 01:08:05,730
- Admiral...
- Not now.

772
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:28,098
Rudi?

773
01:08:28,482 --> 01:08:29,762
Admiral.

774
01:08:32,355 --> 01:08:34,114
I have some bad news
about your boat.

775
01:08:54,210 --> 01:08:56,931
According to the cave painting,
this is the place.

776
01:09:01,379 --> 01:09:05,187
You know, Al, if we were here
150 years ago,

777
01:09:05,411 --> 01:09:07,715
we'd be swimming right now.

778
01:09:20,195 --> 01:09:21,411
Hey.

779
01:09:21,827 --> 01:09:23,779
Hey, you know how it is
when you see someone

780
01:09:24,003 --> 01:09:26,083
that you haven't seen
since high school,

781
01:09:26,307 --> 01:09:28,131
and they got some dead-end job,

782
01:09:28,323 --> 01:09:30,499
and they're married to some woman
that hates them,

783
01:09:30,851 --> 01:09:33,123
they got, like, three kids
that thinks he's a joke?

784
01:09:33,315 --> 01:09:35,747
Wasn't there some point
where he stood back and said,

785
01:09:35,971 --> 01:09:38,371
"Bob, don't take that job.

786
01:09:38,595 --> 01:09:41,763
Bob, don't marry that harpy,"
you know?

787
01:09:41,955 --> 01:09:43,395
Your point?

788
01:09:43,619 --> 01:09:46,691
Well, we're in the middle of a desert,

789
01:09:46,883 --> 01:09:49,411
Iooking for the source
of a river pollutant,

790
01:09:49,603 --> 01:09:53,731
using as our map a cave drawing
of a Civil War gunship,

791
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,427
- Which is also in the desert.
- Right.

792
01:09:55,651 --> 01:09:57,635
So I was just wondering
when we're gonna have to sit down

793
01:09:57,892 --> 01:10:00,547
and reevaluate
our decision-making paradigm.

794
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:02,884
I don't know.

795
01:10:03,715 --> 01:10:05,795
Working so far.

796
01:10:23,107 --> 01:10:24,835
- Hey, Al.
- Yep?

797
01:10:25,027 --> 01:10:26,884
- Let me see the scope.
- Sure.

798
01:10:27,907 --> 01:10:30,468
- What do you see?
- I don't know.

799
01:10:36,036 --> 01:10:37,987
It looks like a solar energy plant.

800
01:10:38,628 --> 01:10:39,619
That's strange.

801
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,396
There's a collecting tower...

802
01:10:44,708 --> 01:10:47,268
...but no outgoing transmission lines.

803
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,316
"Massarde Enterprises."

804
01:10:53,508 --> 01:10:55,332
Massarde? Yves Massarde?

805
01:10:55,876 --> 01:10:58,948
Well, whoever it is,
they've got heavy security.

806
01:11:06,180 --> 01:11:07,748
Let's check it out.

807
01:11:43,429 --> 01:11:44,612
Come on! Come on! Come on!

808
01:11:48,293 --> 01:11:49,765
Come on, come on!

809
01:11:54,661 --> 01:11:55,909
Al!

810
01:12:15,973 --> 01:12:18,277
Come on, Eva, kick him. Let's go!

811
01:12:19,077 --> 01:12:21,029
One, two, three.

812
01:12:23,077 --> 01:12:24,485
I got you.

813
01:12:59,238 --> 01:13:00,678
- You okay?
- Yes.

814
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:02,661
- Nice job, doc.
- Thank you.

815
01:13:02,853 --> 01:13:04,293
- How we doing, Al?
- Great.

816
01:13:04,518 --> 01:13:06,213
Get in the hole.

817
01:13:35,462 --> 01:13:38,310
- Admiral!
- Not now, Rudi. I don't have time.

818
01:13:38,534 --> 01:13:41,414
Yes, sir, you do.

819
01:13:47,910 --> 01:13:50,278
That... That's not possible.

820
01:13:56,678 --> 01:14:00,710
Yellow Five, report to station three,

821
01:14:03,175 --> 01:14:08,102
Loading procedure commencing,
Extraction protocol complete,

822
01:14:15,526 --> 01:14:17,671
Please ensure all active materials

823
01:14:17,895 --> 01:14:20,614
are securely stored,
Thank you for your cooperation,

824
01:14:20,806 --> 01:14:22,759
- What the hell is this place?
- Good question.

825
01:14:26,727 --> 01:14:29,575
These barrels here are probably full
of chemical waste.

826
01:14:30,727 --> 01:14:32,391
They're going in that chamber...

827
01:14:34,983 --> 01:14:37,159
...they're coming out
the other side empty.

828
01:14:39,303 --> 01:14:42,599
They're using the solar power
to superheat and vaporize the toxins.

829
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:43,847
That's smart. Looks clean too.

830
01:14:43,911 --> 01:14:45,831
That's smart. Looks clean too.

831
01:14:46,823 --> 01:14:48,519
What about those barrels?

832
01:15:32,711 --> 01:15:34,600
Hi. How are you?

833
01:15:40,520 --> 01:15:42,215
Oh, my God.

834
01:15:46,631 --> 01:15:49,832
Well, I think we found your source.

835
01:16:13,768 --> 01:16:15,720
Tuareg prisoners.

836
01:16:16,392 --> 01:16:19,208
These must be the soldiers
captured from Modibo's village.

837
01:16:19,400 --> 01:16:21,064
He thought they were dead.

838
01:16:21,256 --> 01:16:24,072
This Massarde guy's really starting
to piss me off.

839
01:16:24,264 --> 01:16:26,152
Well, it's time to call in the cavalry.

840
01:16:27,432 --> 01:16:28,744
Let's go.

841
01:16:30,792 --> 01:16:33,672
Well, Dr. Rojas, I do wish
you had stayed in Lagos.

842
01:16:41,224 --> 01:16:42,537
So...

843
01:16:42,984 --> 01:16:44,457
... got your report,

844
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,473
Kind of dense, huh?

845
01:16:49,416 --> 01:16:51,528
Okay, my understanding is...

846
01:16:52,072 --> 01:16:55,497
...there's a problem with the water.
Am I right?

847
01:16:55,752 --> 01:16:56,681
Rudi?

848
01:16:56,873 --> 01:16:59,145
The water in the Niger River
is being poisoned.

849
01:16:59,496 --> 01:17:03,336
Right now, it's in Mali,
but it's headed toward us fast.

850
01:17:03,561 --> 01:17:06,825
If we don't do something, within
one week it's gonna hit the Atlantic.

851
01:17:07,464 --> 01:17:10,248
And when that interacts
with the salt water,

852
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:12,777
that growth rate is gonna explode.

853
01:17:13,608 --> 01:17:15,689
The oxygen levels
in the affected waters

854
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:19,657
will decrease by 40 to 60 percent,
killing all plant and animal life.

855
01:17:20,073 --> 01:17:21,801
If it gets to the ocean,

856
01:17:21,993 --> 01:17:24,585
it's halfway to New York
within six months.

857
01:17:24,777 --> 01:17:26,697
Then there's nothing we can do.

858
01:17:29,961 --> 01:17:31,369
Is that all?

859
01:17:38,217 --> 01:17:41,257
Do you have
any independent confirmation?

860
01:17:41,737 --> 01:17:43,113
- Nope.
- Because intervening

861
01:17:43,305 --> 01:17:45,801
in a sovereign country, granted I'm
only in the job a couple of months,

862
01:17:46,025 --> 01:17:48,010
I'm pretty sure that's gonna
be tough to get an okay for.

863
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:50,506
- I need you to try.
- Oh, I'm gonna look into this. I am.

864
01:17:50,698 --> 01:17:54,121
I'm gonna pass this on to the State
Department, get their take on this.

865
01:17:54,346 --> 01:17:56,905
Okay, I think that's the best way
to proceed.

866
01:17:57,097 --> 01:17:59,050
Thank you, gentlemen.

867
01:18:24,841 --> 01:18:26,250
Al.

868
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,634
Where the hell are we?

869
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:34,057
I don't know.

870
01:18:34,858 --> 01:18:35,818
Where's Eva?

871
01:18:36,169 --> 01:18:39,306
So the two Americans,
they're on their way, general.

872
01:18:40,714 --> 01:18:42,730
The doctor? Well...

873
01:18:42,954 --> 01:18:45,674
I'm afraid there has been
an incident, general.

874
01:18:45,866 --> 01:18:49,098
An exchange of gunfire,
most unfortunate.

875
01:18:50,922 --> 01:18:53,226
She... She's dead.

876
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:57,194
Yes, general. I'm sorry, I...

877
01:19:03,914 --> 01:19:07,242
You know, Dr. Rojas,
you're lucky I'm such a gentleman.

878
01:19:08,042 --> 01:19:12,746
Enabling program, phase two,
Please ensure all active materials...

879
01:19:12,938 --> 01:19:14,922
Who else knows you're here?

880
01:19:20,651 --> 01:19:24,746
This facility is a miracle
of modern science.

881
01:19:24,938 --> 01:19:26,666
State-of-the-art technology.

882
01:19:26,858 --> 01:19:28,970
Solar energy harnessed
to destroy the world's contaminants.

883
01:19:29,162 --> 01:19:30,794
Not such a bad idea after all.

884
01:19:30,986 --> 01:19:32,971
- It's a toxic-waste dump.
- It's not so simple.

885
01:19:33,194 --> 01:19:36,043
You see, all new technology
has enemies.

886
01:19:36,235 --> 01:19:38,378
Sandstorms, for example,
they chip away at the mirrors.

887
01:19:38,570 --> 01:19:41,899
Productivity falls, and the waste
needs to be stored underground.

888
01:19:42,155 --> 01:19:47,275
So we have developed new laminate
coating to protect the mirrors.

889
01:19:47,467 --> 01:19:52,106
And with this new approach, our
problems should now be in the past.

890
01:19:52,298 --> 01:19:54,251
You're poisoning
a river system underground.

891
01:19:55,051 --> 01:19:57,483
It's spreading across Western Africa.

892
01:20:00,011 --> 01:20:03,243
You're wrong. That's impossible.

893
01:20:04,203 --> 01:20:05,771
Securing burn chamber,

894
01:20:06,571 --> 01:20:07,595
Who else knows you're here?

895
01:20:08,811 --> 01:20:10,123
The Nigerian government.

896
01:20:10,795 --> 01:20:12,107
The WHO.

897
01:20:17,675 --> 01:20:20,043
No one else knows you're here,
do they?

898
01:20:23,723 --> 01:20:25,995
Initiate system safety check,

899
01:20:32,619 --> 01:20:34,315
What are you doing?

900
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,147
I got it.

901
01:20:40,747 --> 01:20:41,739
Die.

902
01:20:45,643 --> 01:20:47,052
Live.

903
01:20:51,564 --> 01:20:52,971
You got it?

904
01:20:56,012 --> 01:20:57,579
Clear?

905
01:20:58,188 --> 01:20:59,211
Got it.

906
01:21:05,739 --> 01:21:07,947
Ready? One, two, three.

907
01:21:08,907 --> 01:21:10,635
One, two, three.

908
01:21:19,788 --> 01:21:22,156
Wait. Not good. Not good. New plan!

909
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,948
- I like it.
- No!

910
01:21:50,125 --> 01:21:51,692
Well...

911
01:21:53,036 --> 01:21:56,108
...that's a new one.
- Yeah.

912
01:21:57,004 --> 01:21:59,372
We're home free now.

913
01:22:02,797 --> 01:22:03,820
Sweet, sweet, sweet

914
01:22:04,045 --> 01:22:06,860
Run fast, she don't
But she swims real well

915
01:22:07,052 --> 01:22:09,740
Racing through the water
With a swish of her tail

916
01:22:09,932 --> 01:22:12,717
She's my little mermaid

917
01:22:22,252 --> 01:22:24,141
Massarde, your packages
have not arrived,

918
01:22:24,364 --> 01:22:25,741
Apparently they were lost
in the desert,

919
01:22:25,933 --> 01:22:28,749
- Yes, I heard.
- Tell me, Yves, the doctor?

920
01:22:28,941 --> 01:22:31,084
- Promise me she's dead.
- Oh, yes, yes.

921
01:22:31,276 --> 01:22:33,709
Be a shame to fall out
over a woman, no?

922
01:22:33,933 --> 01:22:35,245
General, I've come here to tell you

923
01:22:35,437 --> 01:22:37,549
that I think we should suspend
waste shipments to the plant

924
01:22:37,741 --> 01:22:38,989
- For the time being.
- Nonsense.

925
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:42,541
The borders are all closed. The sick
are either quarantined or dead.

926
01:22:42,765 --> 01:22:46,157
I did not expend all these resources
only to see my profits shrink.

927
01:22:46,413 --> 01:22:47,853
Yes, but I have good reasons
to believe

928
01:22:48,109 --> 01:22:49,837
the toxins are in the Niger River.

929
01:22:50,029 --> 01:22:53,357
Then the problem is no longer ours,
but our neighbors' downstream.

930
01:22:53,613 --> 01:22:55,085
They will soon find out.
The Americans did.

931
01:22:55,309 --> 01:22:59,181
Okay, Yves, as you please.
Close the plant.

932
01:22:59,405 --> 01:23:02,797
But your payments to me
will continue.

933
01:23:03,501 --> 01:23:05,198
Okay?

934
01:23:05,774 --> 01:23:08,366
Don't worry. It's Africa.

935
01:23:08,558 --> 01:23:11,469
Nobody cares about Africa.

936
01:23:14,510 --> 01:23:16,685
This photo was taken 24 hours ago.

937
01:23:17,421 --> 01:23:19,886
Normally, Kazim likes to keep his tanks
where he can see them,

938
01:23:20,141 --> 01:23:22,029
in case the people get frisky.

939
01:23:22,253 --> 01:23:25,070
This one, taken four hours ago,

940
01:23:25,262 --> 01:23:28,109
shows the tanks mobilizing north
to the desert.

941
01:23:28,301 --> 01:23:31,598
And my guess,
and intelligence supports this,

942
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:35,086
- They're looking for your boys.
- Well, we'll have to find them first.

943
01:23:35,278 --> 01:23:36,590
We already did.

944
01:23:36,782 --> 01:23:39,086
Yesterday they showed up
in a Tuareg village

945
01:23:39,278 --> 01:23:42,862
- About 200 miles northwest of Gao.
- That's within range.

946
01:23:43,054 --> 01:23:44,942
You could get choppers in there
if you flew at night.

947
01:23:45,166 --> 01:23:48,014
- But your boys already left.
- Left? Where? Going where?

948
01:23:48,238 --> 01:23:51,406
Well, based on their behavior
so far...

949
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:54,317
...I have no idea.

950
01:25:13,902 --> 01:25:16,975
- Dirk.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I see it.

951
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:25,935
Well, you don't see that every day.

952
01:25:38,735 --> 01:25:42,159
I bet you 100
there's a toolkit in there.

953
01:25:42,383 --> 01:25:46,960
I don't wanna rain on
your crazy parade, buddy,

954
01:25:47,152 --> 01:25:50,063
but I don't think we can fix this thing.

955
01:26:26,352 --> 01:26:28,879
- A little more to the left, Al.
- Left.

956
01:26:31,375 --> 01:26:35,152
Yeah, that's it, right there. Right there.
We're dialed in, baby.

957
01:26:57,136 --> 01:26:58,640
- Hello.
- Hey, admiral.

958
01:26:58,864 --> 01:27:00,240
- Dirk?
- How you doing?

959
01:27:00,432 --> 01:27:03,056
Oh, Dirk, thank God,
Where the hell are you?

960
01:27:03,281 --> 01:27:07,056
Well, that's a damn good question.
Listen, I've got some bad news.

961
01:27:07,248 --> 01:27:09,456
Your buddy, Yves Massarde,
he's got an industrial factory

962
01:27:09,648 --> 01:27:11,825
that's dumping deadly toxins
into the Niger.

963
01:27:12,017 --> 01:27:15,056
- Massarde? Oh, Christ.
- I think he's got Eva at his plant.

964
01:27:15,248 --> 01:27:17,840
Which hopefully is gonna be
our next stop.

965
01:27:18,032 --> 01:27:21,680
Well, I've got something for you.
Rudi's got chemistry here

966
01:27:21,872 --> 01:27:25,328
that says if that leak's not shut down
ASAP, it's gonna reach the ocean,

967
01:27:25,553 --> 01:27:29,329
When it does, that'll be ground zero
for the Atlantic's version of Chernobyl.

968
01:27:29,521 --> 01:27:30,929
- I get it.
- I've got something more,

969
01:27:31,153 --> 01:27:33,265
I've got word that Kazim
has mobilized his troops

970
01:27:33,488 --> 01:27:34,928
and is heading across the desert.

971
01:27:35,185 --> 01:27:37,328
We could use some serious muscle
here, admiral.

972
01:27:37,553 --> 01:27:39,761
Well, you're not gonna get it.
Not fast enough.

973
01:27:39,953 --> 01:27:42,320
I'm getting the D.C. two-step bigtime.

974
01:27:42,545 --> 01:27:44,497
- And this has to be done...
- Yesterday. I got it.

975
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:46,289
Hey!

976
01:27:46,961 --> 01:27:48,593
- Dirk?
- Yeah?

977
01:27:48,785 --> 01:27:50,672
I can't ask you boys to go this alone.

978
01:27:50,897 --> 01:27:53,105
Well, that's the great part, sir.

979
01:27:53,297 --> 01:27:54,929
You know you never have to.

980
01:28:09,009 --> 01:28:11,281
There is no more time, Modibo.

981
01:28:11,473 --> 01:28:14,705
Now is your chance to hit Kazim
where it really hurts.

982
01:28:15,089 --> 01:28:17,393
We only have small arms.

983
01:28:17,585 --> 01:28:20,081
They are no use against concrete
and heavy machine guns.

984
01:28:20,497 --> 01:28:22,513
But you have power in numbers.

985
01:28:22,737 --> 01:28:25,617
We attack when he does not
expect it. We have to try.

986
01:28:25,842 --> 01:28:29,490
Do you know what Kazim's war
with us has cost my people in lives?

987
01:28:29,682 --> 01:28:33,234
- In the poverty and disease it causes?
- Then come with us.

988
01:28:33,522 --> 01:28:34,609
And let's finish it.

989
01:28:37,521 --> 01:28:41,778
I cannot afford to have my men
slaughtered in a full-frontal attack.

990
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:44,658
We cannot go with you.

991
01:28:44,850 --> 01:28:46,737
I understand.

992
01:28:48,849 --> 01:28:50,994
All right, we got another idea.

993
01:28:55,602 --> 01:28:57,842
Can I borrow your car?

994
01:29:15,922 --> 01:29:17,618
Kazim. Kazim!

995
01:29:28,018 --> 01:29:29,938
Had you going there, didn't we?

996
01:29:30,290 --> 01:29:31,282
You?

997
01:29:31,858 --> 01:29:33,234
Hi. How are you?

998
01:29:43,378 --> 01:29:45,746
Zakara, go get the doctor.

999
01:29:50,323 --> 01:29:51,794
Move on ahead. Let's go.

1000
01:29:57,874 --> 01:30:00,754
- Where is everybody?
- I don't know, corporate retreat?

1001
01:30:01,939 --> 01:30:03,346
Go.

1002
01:30:04,114 --> 01:30:07,987
Something's wrong here, Al.
This place is completely deserted.

1003
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:18,898
Modibo.

1004
01:30:27,123 --> 01:30:28,051
Nobody home.

1005
01:30:28,915 --> 01:30:30,322
- Hey, Al?
- Yeah.

1006
01:30:30,547 --> 01:30:33,139
What would you do if you were about
to be exposed as the worst polluter

1007
01:30:33,331 --> 01:30:34,611
of modern times?

1008
01:30:34,803 --> 01:30:36,307
I don't know. Run for president?

1009
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:38,931
- You'd hide the evidence, right?
- Yeah, right.

1010
01:30:39,155 --> 01:30:40,563
How?

1011
01:30:40,755 --> 01:30:42,867
How do you hide 50 tons
of industrial waste

1012
01:30:43,059 --> 01:30:44,691
without anybody noticing it?

1013
01:30:46,675 --> 01:30:48,115
You don't.

1014
01:30:49,779 --> 01:30:53,939
- He's gonna blow the place, Al.
- That's not exactly subtle.

1015
01:30:54,131 --> 01:30:55,955
That's what he's gonna do.

1016
01:30:56,403 --> 01:30:58,899
That's why it's abandoned.
Make it look like an industrial accident,

1017
01:30:59,123 --> 01:31:00,531
- And he walks.
- That's a good idea.

1018
01:31:00,723 --> 01:31:02,739
- No, not really.
- Why?

1019
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:04,659
The toxins
would be sealed underground,

1020
01:31:04,851 --> 01:31:07,347
and there would be no way
to contain them, Al.

1021
01:31:07,571 --> 01:31:10,803
Look, to bring this place down, he'd
need 20 or 30 military-grade devices,

1022
01:31:10,995 --> 01:31:13,268
all wired for simultaneous detonation.

1023
01:31:13,460 --> 01:31:17,300
It would never look like an accident.
Unless one centrally placed device

1024
01:31:17,555 --> 01:31:21,236
diverted all the plant's stored energy
into one massive explosion.

1025
01:31:21,428 --> 01:31:22,931
- Which would look like an accident.
- Yes.

1026
01:31:23,187 --> 01:31:24,884
Well, we gotta get that bomb, Al.

1027
01:31:25,076 --> 01:31:27,443
No, I'll find the bomb,
you get the girl.

1028
01:31:28,403 --> 01:31:29,332
Deal.

1029
01:31:43,540 --> 01:31:45,172
That's it.

1030
01:31:50,099 --> 01:31:52,788
Got it. Bomb in a barrel.

1031
01:32:08,596 --> 01:32:09,524
Come on.

1032
01:32:27,669 --> 01:32:30,516
Get in. Get us out of here. Now!

1033
01:32:30,708 --> 01:32:32,181
Come on, let's go!

1034
01:32:45,621 --> 01:32:49,301
- Eva. Out, out, out!
- Don't shoot!

1035
01:32:50,709 --> 01:32:53,460
- Back off. Back off! Move!
- Easy.

1036
01:32:53,685 --> 01:32:55,605
I apologize, Mr. Pitt.

1037
01:32:56,436 --> 01:32:58,965
- This is not what it appears.
- Did I miss something?

1038
01:32:59,637 --> 01:33:01,428
I've seen your toxic dump.

1039
01:33:01,908 --> 01:33:05,525
I've seen the sick Tuareg women
and kids, and I saw the dead in Asselar.

1040
01:33:05,717 --> 01:33:07,188
- I leave something out?
- Dirk!

1041
01:33:10,325 --> 01:33:12,693
Get this thing out of here, quick!
Stay here and don't move!

1042
01:33:40,213 --> 01:33:41,141
Stop!

1043
01:33:42,358 --> 01:33:43,798
Eva!

1044
01:33:44,374 --> 01:33:47,446
Take us up 1,000 meters
and circle the plant.

1045
01:34:02,902 --> 01:34:04,309
Remote system activated,

1046
01:34:04,565 --> 01:34:07,510
All personnel, please move
to designated safety areas,

1047
01:34:42,038 --> 01:34:43,414
Initiate mirror positioning,

1048
01:35:43,351 --> 01:35:46,103
Temperature threshold, 10 percent,

1049
01:36:06,103 --> 01:36:07,511
Come on. Come on.

1050
01:36:51,255 --> 01:36:53,208
Commence incineration burn,

1051
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,008
In five, four, three,

1052
01:36:58,551 --> 01:37:00,471
two, one,

1053
01:37:28,472 --> 01:37:30,648
Warning: Malfunction detected,

1054
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,144
Initiate emergency shutdown,

1055
01:37:33,336 --> 01:37:36,120
Thank you, and have a nice da...

1056
01:37:36,920 --> 01:37:38,680
Get us out of here, quick.

1057
01:37:42,008 --> 01:37:43,321
Eva.

1058
01:37:44,824 --> 01:37:47,128
How many times
am I gonna have to save your ass?

1059
01:37:47,320 --> 01:37:49,976
Well, in case you didn't notice,
I actually saved yours.

1060
01:37:50,168 --> 01:37:51,160
I wasn't in any danger.

1061
01:37:51,385 --> 01:37:53,977
- Oh, no?
- No, I'd have thought of something.

1062
01:37:54,169 --> 01:37:55,256
Come here.

1063
01:37:57,304 --> 01:37:59,128
We gotta go.

1064
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,233
Hey, what's with the costumes?

1065
01:38:15,577 --> 01:38:17,368
Uniforms? It's his idea.

1066
01:38:18,105 --> 01:38:21,241
Hey, by the way, with this plan
of yours, do we have enough gas?

1067
01:38:21,433 --> 01:38:23,800
Oh, stop being so negative, Al.

1068
01:38:43,961 --> 01:38:45,849
- It's coming around on our 6.
- Yeah.

1069
01:38:48,665 --> 01:38:51,513
It's Kazim.
Hey, maybe he wants his car back.

1070
01:39:19,226 --> 01:39:21,689
Al, did you bring any of the explosives
from Massarde's?

1071
01:39:21,945 --> 01:39:23,162
- Couldn't find them.
- Al.

1072
01:39:23,354 --> 01:39:24,410
- I didn't have time.
- Al!

1073
01:39:24,665 --> 01:39:26,042
Of course I brought the explosives!

1074
01:39:26,234 --> 01:39:28,730
Eva, I hope you don't throw like a girl.

1075
01:39:42,554 --> 01:39:43,994
He's coming around.

1076
01:39:54,138 --> 01:39:56,058
Al, I need a door right now!

1077
01:40:09,114 --> 01:40:10,810
Oh, my hat!

1078
01:40:12,282 --> 01:40:13,562
Damn it!

1079
01:40:22,266 --> 01:40:23,739
Okay, here's the plan.

1080
01:40:23,994 --> 01:40:26,778
Eva, get in the back seat
behind me. Go!

1081
01:40:26,970 --> 01:40:27,898
- Al?
- Yeah.

1082
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:30,234
- Give her that bag of explosives.
- Gotcha!

1083
01:40:30,426 --> 01:40:31,962
All right, hold on!

1084
01:40:33,882 --> 01:40:34,810
Yeah.

1085
01:40:37,210 --> 01:40:41,050
Eva, I need you to throw a bundle
of the dynamite into that hillside

1086
01:40:41,274 --> 01:40:42,651
every time I say. Comprende?

1087
01:40:42,843 --> 01:40:43,962
- Yeah.
- All right.

1088
01:40:45,978 --> 01:40:47,034
I'm good!

1089
01:40:50,970 --> 01:40:52,187
Now!

1090
01:40:58,554 --> 01:41:01,179
Get us out. Move. Move!

1091
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:06,875
- Dirk, we need cover!
- I'm working on it!

1092
01:41:24,091 --> 01:41:26,459
Oh, my God.

1093
01:41:36,827 --> 01:41:39,004
Come on, Eva. Let's go, let's go.

1094
01:41:39,964 --> 01:41:41,147
Come on!

1095
01:41:46,171 --> 01:41:47,740
Move, move!

1096
01:41:53,659 --> 01:41:55,739
Eva, help me dig.
Come on, let's go, let's go!

1097
01:41:59,932 --> 01:42:01,019
- How we looking, Al?
- Great.

1098
01:42:03,004 --> 01:42:04,348
Dig faster!

1099
01:42:05,116 --> 01:42:06,172
Need a little help, Al.

1100
01:42:14,011 --> 01:42:15,036
Go.

1101
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:20,923
- Al?
- Yeah.

1102
01:42:21,148 --> 01:42:23,676
You didn't see any extra fuel tanks
on that bird, did you?

1103
01:42:23,899 --> 01:42:25,756
- No, I didn't see any.
- That means he only has

1104
01:42:25,948 --> 01:42:27,355
20 to 30 minutes left
of flight time.

1105
01:42:27,580 --> 01:42:30,940
These walls are about 2 feet thick
with a double-steel coating,

1106
01:42:31,196 --> 01:42:35,324
so there's no way his bullets can get
to us. We just sit tight, wait him out.

1107
01:42:35,516 --> 01:42:36,604
Eva, down!

1108
01:42:43,644 --> 01:42:45,820
- Say, Dirk?
- Yeah.

1109
01:42:46,364 --> 01:42:48,828
You wanna talk me
through that again?

1110
01:42:49,052 --> 01:42:51,836
- Armor-piercing rounds.
- Yeah.

1111
01:42:52,284 --> 01:42:53,916
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1112
01:42:54,588 --> 01:42:55,516
I'm fine.

1113
01:43:09,917 --> 01:43:11,324
Hey, Al.

1114
01:43:11,516 --> 01:43:12,860
- No, Dirk.
- Oh, yeah.

1115
01:43:13,052 --> 01:43:14,333
No, it'll never work.

1116
01:43:14,525 --> 01:43:16,956
- Why not?
- It's 150 years old.

1117
01:43:17,180 --> 01:43:18,461
But, Al, it's hardly ever been used.

1118
01:43:18,653 --> 01:43:21,500
- It'll probably blow us to bits!
- Well, then at least we'll die fighting.

1119
01:43:21,725 --> 01:43:24,029
- Yeah, that's comforting.
- We need to open that gun port.

1120
01:43:24,221 --> 01:43:25,469
What the hell are we doing, guys?

1121
01:43:29,981 --> 01:43:31,709
- I've gotta go outside.
- All right, go.

1122
01:43:43,388 --> 01:43:44,893
Civil War piece of...

1123
01:43:49,021 --> 01:43:50,333
That's it, Al.

1124
01:44:05,405 --> 01:44:06,845
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1125
01:44:07,773 --> 01:44:09,277
Next time, you go.

1126
01:44:09,533 --> 01:44:10,941
- What the hell took you so long?
- What?

1127
01:44:11,197 --> 01:44:12,477
- Hey, guys.
- I stopped for coffee.

1128
01:44:12,669 --> 01:44:14,077
- Get a receipt?
- Yeah, I got a receipt.

1129
01:44:14,301 --> 01:44:15,869
- I got you one too.
- You're the best, Al.

1130
01:44:16,093 --> 01:44:18,558
You know what? I'll even get you
the money from Sandecker.

1131
01:44:18,781 --> 01:44:20,637
- Guys!
- What?

1132
01:44:23,613 --> 01:44:24,637
Oh, great.

1133
01:44:25,758 --> 01:44:26,941
Now we're really in trouble.

1134
01:44:27,966 --> 01:44:29,437
- Incoming!
- Down!

1135
01:44:36,733 --> 01:44:37,950
Okay.

1136
01:44:38,269 --> 01:44:40,189
If we bring down Kazim,
the army will surrender.

1137
01:44:40,446 --> 01:44:42,013
- Cut the head off the snake...
- Body dies.

1138
01:44:42,270 --> 01:44:44,541
Exactly. We're gonna need
cannonball, powder and fuses.

1139
01:44:44,733 --> 01:44:47,262
- I'll get the cannonball.
- Eva, I need you to find the fuses.

1140
01:44:47,486 --> 01:44:48,798
They're gonna be in a box this size.

1141
01:44:48,990 --> 01:44:51,134
They look something
like carrot sticks. Go.

1142
01:45:17,182 --> 01:45:18,590
- 150 yards!
- How you feeling, Al?

1143
01:45:18,846 --> 01:45:20,094
- I got them!
- Good, good, good.

1144
01:45:21,182 --> 01:45:22,302
Incoming!

1145
01:45:43,006 --> 01:45:46,334
Jefferson Davis had how
many samples made?

1146
01:45:49,118 --> 01:45:51,103
- Let's get that cannon out the porthole.
- Yeah.

1147
01:45:52,414 --> 01:45:54,206
On the count of three,
we're gonna pull. Ready, Al?

1148
01:45:54,398 --> 01:45:55,966
- Ready.
- One, two, three.

1149
01:46:08,383 --> 01:46:09,759
- Yeah!
- That's it!

1150
01:46:15,519 --> 01:46:17,055
- Bring me up 30 degrees, Al.
- Yeah.

1151
01:46:20,607 --> 01:46:21,919
Got it.

1152
01:46:43,775 --> 01:46:46,303
I'm so tired of being shot at!

1153
01:46:46,591 --> 01:46:49,503
Hold your positions.
Secure the area. I will finish this.

1154
01:47:16,415 --> 01:47:17,375
Go! Go!

1155
01:47:36,095 --> 01:47:37,120
No! Get it now!

1156
01:47:38,144 --> 01:47:39,551
Get it out!

1157
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,824
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1158
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:55,168
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1159
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:57,248
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1160
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:59,360
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1161
01:48:14,112 --> 01:48:15,873
Look, look, look, look, look.

1162
01:48:20,736 --> 01:48:22,656
Looks like you killed the snake.

1163
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:24,928
There's no way that

1164
01:48:25,152 --> 01:48:28,000
- That should've worked, right?
- That should've worked.

1165
01:49:25,249 --> 01:49:26,753
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1166
01:49:35,425 --> 01:49:37,249
Yeah!

1167
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:47,746
You know, from our point of view,
the great thing is, we capped the plant.

1168
01:49:47,969 --> 01:49:49,282
The river's safe.

1169
01:49:49,474 --> 01:49:52,162
And I also understand
the WHO is administering

1170
01:49:52,354 --> 01:49:56,482
an antitoxin in the villages
formulated from Dr. Rojas' samples.

1171
01:49:56,674 --> 01:49:58,913
- Better late than never.
- Absolutely.

1172
01:49:59,137 --> 01:50:04,002
So I trust your work on
the Texas is going well?

1173
01:50:04,258 --> 01:50:06,114
Giordino's on the job,
making sure everything

1174
01:50:06,306 --> 01:50:08,034
gets where it's supposed to go,

1175
01:50:08,226 --> 01:50:11,682
- All right!
- Say, probably not true,

1176
01:50:11,905 --> 01:50:16,513
but did I hear a rumor there's some
American gold onboard, on the Texas?

1177
01:50:16,705 --> 01:50:19,105
Really? Be nice if it were true.

1178
01:50:19,330 --> 01:50:22,690
No. I can assure you, there's no gold
there belonging to the U.S.

1179
01:50:24,673 --> 01:50:27,042
Admiral, the administration
was highly impressed

1180
01:50:27,266 --> 01:50:30,466
with the way you expedited
all the red tape down here.

1181
01:50:30,690 --> 01:50:33,058
- They'd like to fold NUMA into...
- No, thanks.

1182
01:50:33,250 --> 01:50:35,394
I'll never work in government again.

1183
01:50:35,586 --> 01:50:37,954
Which is exactly what
they said you'd say.

1184
01:50:38,690 --> 01:50:41,570
Look, they're offering full funding
in exchange for

1185
01:50:41,794 --> 01:50:44,066
the occasional side job
for the good guys.

1186
01:50:44,258 --> 01:50:47,330
- Who decides who the good guys are?
- You only do the jobs you want.

1187
01:50:51,106 --> 01:50:53,474
- I need a new yacht.
- You got it.

1188
01:50:54,467 --> 01:50:56,195
- And Rudi needs new computers.
- No, no, no.

1189
01:50:56,387 --> 01:50:57,762
Done.

1190
01:51:02,627 --> 01:51:04,482
There's one more thing.

1191
01:51:15,042 --> 01:51:17,634
Negligence is a gray area
of the law, Yves.

1192
01:51:17,858 --> 01:51:20,930
If the right people are approached
and handled in the right manner,

1193
01:51:21,122 --> 01:51:23,747
I think we avoid
prosecution completely.

1194
01:51:45,091 --> 01:51:49,347
Not bad, eh? You, me,
the bay of Monterey.

1195
01:51:52,451 --> 01:51:53,827
You know, I was thinking.

1196
01:51:54,499 --> 01:51:56,739
Remember that day in the desert?

1197
01:51:56,931 --> 01:51:59,299
With the car, dynamite,

1198
01:51:59,523 --> 01:52:02,083
Kazim's chasing us in the helicopter?

1199
01:52:02,307 --> 01:52:04,195
Yeah?

1200
01:52:04,387 --> 01:52:08,195
There's something I wanted to say
to you that I never got a chance to.

1201
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:10,243
What's that?

1202
01:52:13,539 --> 01:52:15,700
You do throw like a girl.

1203
01:52:16,740 --> 01:52:18,787
Hey! You do!
